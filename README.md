# Pentry

## Description

Pentry is an app that helps fountain pen hobbyists keep track of their pens, inks, and other tools.

App is designed with common pain points of maintaining a collection in mind - what pens and inks are currently used, for how long, which inks are not used; keeping track of wish list and ongoing deliveries. This is a shortlist of MVP features.

The project is very early in the development and other useful features will be considered in the future.

## Running the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder and deploys it to Github Pages.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
